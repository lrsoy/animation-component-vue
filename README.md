# animation-component-vue

Used to study animation between components, based on vue and typescript, using tailwindcss and scss to manage component styles

# purpose

1. Mainly used to learn and practice, component animation and routing animation
2. Suitable for some good animations on mobile and pc

# practicality

It is completely personal preference. I want to learn animations of some components. One day in the future, I hope to build a website of my own through my own learning, and these animations are for laying some foundations in the future.
